0.2

- Dinguses now yield exactly one item when iterated over. Previously, they
always iterated infinitely.

- Added a helper function to specify return values when creating dinguses:
Dingus(foo=returner(5)) will make the dingus' foo method return 5. All
returner() does is create a dingus with the specified return_value.

- Renamed the "one" method to "once". "one" still exists but is deprecated.

- Improved examples.

- Added ability to exclude objects when isolating with DingusTestCase. Give
DingusTestCase an "exclude" keyword argument that lists the names of the
objects that should be left alone (see examples/isolation).

- Fixed an exception when using tuples as keys in a dingus. (Thanks, Christian
Wyglendowski)

- Added support for pickling dinguses (Thanks, Tanel KÃ¼laots)
